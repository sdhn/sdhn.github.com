title: San Diego Hacker News Meetup
description: San Diego Hacker News Meetup
---


As Jacob put it, "for the purpose of developing a [hacker][hacker subculture] community" in San Diego. Note: We're different from the [2600 group][]. Wikipedia lists 3 different meanings for ['hacker'][hacker (computing)]: We're hobbyists, tinkerers, and builders of cool things (with an entrepreneurial bent). This is different from the blackhat / whitehat hackers, who are loosely speaking, breakers of things.

You don't specifically need to be a frequent reader of [Hacker News][] -- as long as you're the type of person who's interested in the types of things found on HN (hacking, startups, etc.), you'll fit in just fine.

Our meet ups are **<font color="red">usually ALWAYS on the LAST FRIDAY of the month</font>**. However, you should [join our Google Groups mailing list][join mailing list] for **<font color="red">last minute event date/time/venue details</font>** (just in case!!!)

Here's a picture from our

Job posting guidelines on the mailing list
------------------------------------------

Job postings are ok but must meet one or more of the following criteria. We're not so much trying to be controlling, we're just making sure it doesn't degenerate into spam and suck for everyone. As long as that doesn't happen, we're pretty accommodating and reasonable.

1. By non-sleeping/lurking SDHN members looking for people to join them working on something cool (doesn't have to be a real job per se, fun side projects are highly encouraged)
2. Personally recommended by the person posting it
3. Or some other value-add over just a blind drive-by posting (use Craiglist for that)
