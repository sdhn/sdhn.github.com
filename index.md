Job posting guidelines on the mailing list
------------------------------------------

Job postings are ok but must meet one or more of the following criteria. We're not so much trying to be controlling, we're just making sure it doesn't degenerate into spam and suck for everyone. As long as that doesn't happen, we're pretty accommodating and reasonable.

1. By non-sleeping/lurking SDHN members looking for people to join them working on something cool (doesn't have to be a real job per se, fun side projects are highly encouraged)
2. Personally recommended by the person posting it
3. Or some other value-add over just a blind drive-by posting (use Craiglist for that)
